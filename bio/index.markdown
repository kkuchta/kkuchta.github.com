# Bio

I'm a software engineer working at Expensify.  My interests are largely around web development, and I go back and forth between client and server sides.  Most of my full time work is in PHP (ugh) and JS.  My freetime work is largely in rails.

I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in upstate NY with a degree in Software Engineering in 2011.
