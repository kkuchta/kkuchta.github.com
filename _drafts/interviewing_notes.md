# All Tech Interviewing Sucks

- Avoid false positives
- Avoid false negatives
  - Remove bias
  - Remove unseen filters
- Repeatable
- As objective as possible

Every tech interviewing technique violates at least one of those

## Algorithms
- Selects for the wrong thing (algorithm skills vs smart and gets stuff done)
- [Stop asking me math questions (HN)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6583580)
- [Optimizing to hire the wrong developer](https://medium.com/p/9a3781d57c4b)
- Good for: actual algorithm-heavy positions.

## Whiteboard questions
- Selects for practice writing code under high pressure on a whiteboard (which no one does)
- Easy to give
- Good for nothing

## Logic Puzzles
- No one uses these anymore
- Appeals to puzzle-lovers, turns off everone else.
- No redeeming qualities other than that they're easy to give.
- As an aside: "to see how you think" is probably bullshit
  - Best answer I've seen is "when they're stumped, do they give up?"
  - Can you "see how they think" with an actual code question?

# Trivia
- "You can look most things up", so not a good test on the face of it
- It's true that experience with a tech stack correlates with more trivia knowledge.
- 2 weeks into ruby, I might know, say, 10% of the standard lib.
- 1 year in, I might know 50%
- 5 years, I might know 90%
- At 5 years, you ask 10 questions, but most of them were in the 10% I don't know
- Too non-deterministic

## Tell me about X
- A time you struggled with a team member
- A big/difficult/hairy problem
  - Follow-up questions are great
- Selects for smooth talkers
  - Great if you're hiring an evangelist.  Wrong for a dev.
  - Easy enough to fake (can you walk the walk?)
- "Spot when they have to go off-script"

## Build X in Y in Z hours (specified tech)
- Good because it's hard to fake
- Can make task very much like actual work
- Conditions are a lot like real work (deadline, use-whatever)
- Repeatable
- biased agains generalists, or otherwise brilliant programmers not conversant in your particular stack

### Build X in whatever in Z hours (unspecified tech)
- Good for same reasons
- A bit less repeatable
- Good for generalists
- Can get solutions that are way out of left field (a mobile game for a web dev position)
- If it doesn't work out, you've wasted a lot of time
- Some people don't work well under so much pressure
- It's hard to get away from toy projects

### Takehome challenge
- Allows more in-depth projects
- Easier to fake (although, in practice, I've never seen this happen)
- Selects against people without a lot of free time, or with many competing offers
- 10 companies asking for a 10-hour challenge each while you have a full-time job is unreasonable
- Good for second chances
- Good for people who can't provide a code sample

### Code samples
- Plays to people's strengths
- Let's them put their best foot forward
- Biased against those who don't code in their spare time (good/bad)
- Biased against those who, for many legit reasons, can't get their previous employer's permission to share code
- Hard for recent grads

### Trial periods

### Contract-to-hire

### Paired programming

### Paired programming

### Reference Checks

### Blind Reference Checks

### Design Questions

### Casual Conversation

### Open Source Work
