If this were a more link-baity blog, I would start explaining some hip new interviewing technique that is better than everything else.  However, the title isn't link-baiting; every major technique for technical interviewing is broken, and you know it (if you follow HackerNews long enough).

1. If you give your candidates logic puzzles, you get people that love logic puzzles, a trait that is weakly (if at all) correlated with development skill.  Fermi problems, riddles, manhole question- don't do them.  Microsoft apparently did these at one point.  Google has either long since stopped using them or never started.

2. Algorithm questions are fun to ask, and make the interviewer feel smart, but unless you're hiring for an algorithm intensive position, I feel your wasting your time.  You don't implement Quicksort in real life; if you are, you have either a truly rare job or you're doing something wrong.  Most developers spend about the same amount of time cleaning their screens, annualy, as they do completing tasks that use their algorithm skills.

3. You can ask background questions ("Tell me about your last big project / a time when you struggled / how you first got into programming"), but those are easy to fake.  You might get useful information, but you might also just be selecting for fast talkers.

4. If you ask for code samples, you miss plenty of good developers who value work-life balance and don't do side projects.

5. The best way to know if someone is worth working with is to work with them, right?  So maybe you should do short-term contracts or trial periods.  Except in this economy, there are a dozen other great companies willing to hire a good developer immediately.

6. You can do in-person real-life coding challenge ("Write tic-tac-toe in the next 30 minute", "Build a reservation system in the next couple hours").  Of course, now you're just selecting for people who know the specific tools and languages you make them use.

7. Paired programming seems like a good way to get a feel for a candidate.  However, paired programming it definitely a skill, and someone not used to having another developer over their shoulder is *not* going to perform well.

8. You can evaluate on hard credentials (years in industry, gpa, etc), but you'll find out what most of the industry already knows by now: those are only weakly associated with the ability to get things done.
