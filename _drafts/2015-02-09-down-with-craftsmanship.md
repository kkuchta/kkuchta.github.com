title: Down With Craftsmanship
---

When I say crafstmanship, I mean an appeal to craftsmanship as an argument.

A debate:
  - A) We should do X
  - B) We should do Y
  - A) Why?
  - B) Because we're craftsmen, pride in our work, etc

Delibrate blindness

Everything in software development is a tradeoff
  - Speed of dev vs maintainability
  - Understandability vs performance
  - Usability vs underyling model

Arguing for "pride in our work" is just one side of a tradeoff masquerading as a platonic ideal.

To be clear, I'm *not* arguing that you should write bad code.  I'm arguing that you should be aware of the tradeoffs you're making

Appealing to craftsmanship is usually part of the "build it fast and get business value now" vs "built it more carefully and hopefully get business value later" debate.  Both sides of that argument have merit, and which one you pick depends on your business needs and the exact weights of each side for the specific codein question.  Appealing to craftsmanship is burrying your head in the sand and declaring one side universally superior.

That kind of purism has no place in the lexicon of a well-rounded developer with any thoughts of seeing beyond his or her narrow field of work.

*somewhere*: craftsmanship is in the *developer's* best interests because it means less work for them.  It may be in the company's best interests to build a crappy version now and then spend more money to build it better later.  Now, it may be that, for a particular problem, it's worth the time to do it right- that the tradeoff makes sense.  Make *that* argument.  Don't appeal to an abstract concept of goodness like this is a moral decision.

So, up with tradeoffs.

Up with carefully considered tradeoffs.

Up with well-written, maintainable code when that is what is in the business' best interest.

Down with "craftsmanship"

Example to work in somewhere

- Your development costs are $50k/mo
- Build it crappy in 3 months (and have to rebuild it a year later in 6 months) or build it well in 6 and never have to rebuild it.
- Project generates $60k/mo once completed.
- Right: costs $300k, ends up generating 780k by the end of 2 years
- Wrong: costs $450k, ends up generating 810k by the end of 2 years
