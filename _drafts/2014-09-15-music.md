Every coder who listens to music while working has their own set of preferences.  Trance jams, country tunes, orchestral metal ballads- everyone's different, and I'm no exception.  I've spent some time building up my playlists, though, and maybe someone out there with similar tastes can benefit from it.

When I'm working, I'm usually looking first for something loud enough to drown out background noise (either muted conversations in my open office, or the loud television in my apartment).  As such, really soft genres like Ambient are out.

I also need to have no intelligible lyrics.  Some people can pay attention to what they're reading/writing while also listening to a compelling set of vocals, but I cannot.  Although I love, for example, classic rock, I have to rule it out for working music.

So, I end up with a set of largely electronic music. I don't like most trance for this because it's a little *too* repetitive and most straight dubstep is a little to heavy for a quiet office.  So, I find myself looking for interesting but not overly distracting electronica.  Here's the list I've come up with:

 - [Ronald Jenkees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r6pBqmanH4&feature=kp) around whom this playlist is sorta based.
 - [Savoy](http://thissongissick.com/2012/savoy-supertrail-ep/#sthash.LYtCGWnc.dpbs)
 - [Ratatat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ohkCQp4xL0&feature=kp)
 - [RJD2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5au2ysDU20&feature=kp)
 - [Zircon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqVlTiXEXUA&feature=kp)
 - A couple songs by [M|O|O|N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0ILqWcd214&feature=kp)
 - [Deceptikon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We-LtHBIBD4)
 - Some stuff by [Glitch Mob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3MH4l1-t_8&feature=kp)
 - [Professor Kliq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxsn4yggQQ4&feature=kp).  Some minimal lyrics, but it's usually only one phrase repeated enough that it doesn't distract me.
 - [PANTyRAiD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGtLJDP1BIk&feature=kp)
 - [Gramatik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYKRPzOi1zI&feature=kp) easily the biggest chunk of my playlist, just because they're so prolific.   Had to filter out a lot of songs with lyrics, though.
 - [Röyksopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RST4R1CEgLQ) A little more mellow, but still good.
 - [Fred V and Grafix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lekF7y4Am4U&feature=kp) A little more trancy than some others, but not too repetetive or droning.
 - [Inf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PndY4zxuV1Y&feature=kp) There are some annoying vocal intros to a few of their tracks, but they're pretty short.
 - LukHash

That's my main playlist.  I'm also working on a secondary one for instrumental metal, since that also fits my above criteria (and actually drowns out television a bit better):

- [Deathmøle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gd8w7qxI4M) is the basis for this.  It's a band with a weird history (created by Jeph Jacques of [QC](http://questionablecontent.net) fame), but a lot of good pure instrumentals.
- [Nightwish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4WLQhIjquk&feature=kp) has a a few great instrumental albums, although unfortunately most of their stuff has lyrics)
- [Karma to Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNGItWw6oy0&feature=kp)
- [Isis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJ6yGCfc6k)

Beyond that I have a few one-off playlists I use when I want a change of pace:

- [Red Army Choir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJ9q7N5e25c), aka the Alexandrov Ensemble.  It's very stirring music in Russian, of which I don't speak a word.  I've found that the lyrics don't distract when I can't understand them!
- String covers, such as [thunderstruck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT3SBzmDxGk), [thrift shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgOzGxcwSDo), or [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JjQGt7WjK0).
- Some heavier electronic music like [Kraddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2igZVV_TFa0) or [Noisia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAO-lzl3vVQ).  This also acts as the dumping ground when I add the entire discography of an artist to the electronic playlist and find a few songs are just a bit to energetic for it.
