title: When Crunch Time is Ok

> Yeeeeaaaahh, I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday

Every single professional developer will, at some point or another, be asked to work overtime.

Sometimes it's a short, one-time thing like staying late some night to fix an important bug.  Other times it's a week or two of long days to hit a deadline.  In extreme cases it's months of 12+ hour days and few weekends.

If you're running a software team, it can definitely seem like an attractive option.  You're under pressure (from your boss or from the market) to get things done good, fast, and cheap.  Asking your group to work overtime is like a cheat code to achieving those goals.

Of course, productivity doesn't come out of thin air.  If your team can produce N units of progress in a week, but you want N+1, you generally have three options:

- Take it out of your money (by hiring more engineers)
- Take it out of your pool of features (by cutting your project's scope)
- Take it out of your developer's free time (by demanding more work without extra pay)

Framed this way, it's pretty easy to see why overtime so attractive to managers: if you're under pressure to meet a goal you can't easily meet with your own resources, uses someone else's.

Framed this way, though, it's *also* easy to see crunch time for what it is: charity.  You're asking your developers to donate their resources to you




One thing to recognize, through all of these guidelines, is that productivity doesn't come out of thin air.  If you want N more units of productivity in a week than you can currently produce, you have three options:

- Take it out of your pool of money (by hiring more engineers)
- Take it out of your pool of features (by cutting back scope on other things you want built)
- Take it out of your developer's free time (by demanding more work without extra pay)

Overtime is Charity: When is crunch time OK?

Time is money.  This adage is true

When framed that way, perhaps you can see why many of the five points above sound like you're trying to persuade your team: because you are.  You're asking them to donate to your company free of charge.  Most companies wouldn't dream of asking their employees for cash, but they'll readily ask for a donation of labor.

Overtime without pay is charity- treat it as such.  Ask, don't demand.  And make sure you have some good reasons!

There's no strict formula, but there are a few factors that can play into whether it's reasonable to ask your employees to work overtime.

### 1. External Deadlines

You need this feature done by the tradeshow, or the next investor meeting, or by a date for a contract with a big partner.  You're a startup- you're all in this together, and your employees will often understand the need to meet a goal for some hard deadline imposed from outside the company.

### 2. Team Buy-in

People are far more willing to hit a deadline they set themselves.  If you tell an engineer it has to be done in three weeks, but it turns out to be a four-week project, it'll be a hard sell to make that engineer work overtime to get it done in three.  If you ask the engineer how long it'll take and they say three weeks, you'll have a much easier time convincing them to get it done on time.  Many motivated devs will go so far as to work extra without prompting to get it finished on time.

### 3. Visible Suffering

I don't mean make your devs suffer.  Rather, I'm referring to when the pain-point a given project addresses is immediately visible to a developer, and it's affecting someone that developer cares about.  Oftentimes this is your users.  If your dev team is seeing the torrent of emails complaining about how the Foo feature has been broken since the last patch, they'll be far more motivated to get it fixed quickly than if all their seeing is a story in Pivotal Tracker.

### 4. Expectations

Many companies explicitly manage expectations of overtime: "We value work-life balance here, and we almost never ask for it" or "We're young and scrappy- we do ask for it now and then."  Usually this expectation is set when a prospective hire interviews.

You also have an implicit set of expectations.  Many developers often reasonably expect a company of several hundred to have a better handle on their planning process than a startup of 5.

If you're asking for a lot of overtime when you've set up either the implicit or explicit expectation that that will almost never happen, you'll feel a lot of pushback.

### 5. Employee Stake

It's a lot easier to get someone with 10% of the company ownership to give up their weekends than someone with 1%.  Once you start handing out less than a quarter of a percent to new hires, don't be surprised if they're less concerned about the success of the company than you are.

None of these factors are silver bullets, but some combination of them is what will determine how much overtime your team will accept.

One thing to recognize, through all of these guidelines, is that productivity doesn't come out of thin air.  If you want N more units of productivity in a week than you can currently produce, you have three options:

- Take it out of your pool of money (by hiring more engineers)
- Take it out of your pool of features (by cutting back scope on other things you want built)
- Take it out of your developer's free time (by demanding more work without extra pay)

If you're asking your developers to work crunch time, you've failed.

Specifically, you've failed at project planning.  You underestimated the work, or over-estimated your resources.

However, in startupland, this is neither uncommon nor particularly bad, since planning failures are a fact of life at small companies.  There are just too many unknowns: the capacities of newly-hired developers, the complexities of features on a rapidly-changing codebase, the vagaries of a user-base you are only beginning to understand.

To clarify- I'm talking about crunch time, not just long hours.  What I mean is hours worked beyond what is "normal" and what your employees have come to expect.  For many companies, that's 40 hours a week.  I've been at startups where the up-front expectation, stated before I accepted the offer, was 50 hours a week.  For many founders, this might end up being 60, 70, or 80 hours a week.  When I say "crunch time", I mean when you take whatever that number of hours is and add 5, 10, or more hours to meet some goal, hit some deadline, or fix some bug.  Sometimes you just find yourself in a situation you didn't plan for, and have to ask your team to work longer and later than normal.

When it's ok to do this is a point of contention.  If you're asking it of your employees when it's not ok, you'll see problems: employee retention issues, moral issues, and quality of work issues.  That is to say: people get pissed.

This is really two blog posts:

1. "When it's ok to work late"

  - Working late is charity
  - Gotta convince them
  - List of conditions
  - No silver bullets

and


2. "Working late is a failure of planning"

  - Productivity doesn't come out of thin air
  - Accept it as a failure
  - At early companies, it happens.
  - At bigger companies, it should be far more rare
  - 
  ? "Because I want to is a bad reason"
