title: The N Rules of Take-Home Interview Challenges
---

So, you've realized that high-pressure, timed, in-person interviews are not great for everyone, and you're afraid of missing out on a great developer that just doesn't do well under those conditions.  You've decided to start issuing take-home challenges for your engineering challenges to do in a more comfortable environment.

Bravo.

<!--Here are the N rules for a good take-home challenge you need to abide by.-->
Here are the N rules I promise to abide by.

## 1.  It'll never be the first step.

A take-home challenge should never be the first step in your interview process.  If I'm going to ask a candidate to invest several hours in my company, I'm going to at least give them a phone screen.  Wasting their time before determining a basic level of fit is a crappy thing to do.

Further, it benefits me to have the take-home challenge further into the interview process, since candidates are more invested in the company by then.  This alleviates the issue of good candidates dropping out of your funnel because other companies are willing to hire them with less arduous tasks.

## 2. It'll have a *very* loose time-limit.

If I wanted to see how much you could get done in an hour, I'd bring you on-site for a challenge like that.  I want to see *what* you can get done, not how fast you do it.

My challenge will give you at least 20x the expected time of the challenge to complete it: a one-hour challenge will be due no less than 20 hours from when you start.  A 5-hour challenge will be due no earlier than 4 days later.

Your time is valuable, and if I expected you to clear your schedule, we'd just organize a traditional real-time interview.

## 3. If the challenge is expected to take more than 6 hours, you'll be paid.
The longer a challenge is, the more likely a good engineer with many excellent prospects is to pass on your company.  Paying for labor incentivizes people to bear with you.  It's also a strong signal that you value their time.


## 4. The challenge will be as close as I can reasonably get to something we do in real-life.

You won't be asked to code a graph-traversal algorithm unless we've had to do that ourselves recently.

Studies have shown that, across all professions, work-sample tests are one of the best indicators of a candidate's future success at the company, where "work-sample" means doing work just like what you'll be doing on the job.  People often try to find clever proxies for software development skill (eg riddle questions or algorithmic questions), but a take-home test lets you test what an engineer will actually be doing once you hire them.  Take advantage of that.


## 5. You'll be given an opportunity to discuss your code.

I am, whenever possible, trying to hire people better than me.  If you're such a person, I probably won't understand exactly why you made every decision you did in your solution.  So, we'll talk it over and you'll have a chance to defend you answer instead of just summarily being dismissed.

## 6. If I'm going to pass on you, you'll get an explanation.

This is hard.  Telling someone "you're not good enough" and getting specific as to why is time-consuming and, for me at least, somewhat emotionally challenging.  But you put in multiple hours on our arbitrary coding test, and you deserve at least that much.

------

This is far from an exhaustive list on how to make a good take-home test.  It doesn't touch on language restrictions, problem structure, instructions, and a number of other aspects on how to do it well.  This is just the bare-minimum that any company offering such a challenge *owes* to their candidates.
