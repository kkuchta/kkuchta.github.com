          <h1 class='title'>I'd like To Hate on Sports Fans</h1>
<p>I’d like to rag on sports fans for their ridiculous tribalism, but then I realize that half my clothing is just one organization or another that I’d like to associate with, and that I feel a sense of camaraderie with those who share those preferences.</p>

<!--break-->


<p>I’d like to make fun of how much time sports fans waste on an ultimately useless pursuit, but then I remember that I spent at least as much time playing video games yesterday as most people will spend today watching football.</p>

<p>I’d like to point out how boring it sounds when fans get together and talk nothing but sports for hours, but then I know what it’s like when I talk programming with my friends.</p>

<p>I’d like to call it “sportsball” and reduce it to silly descriptions like “large sweaty men moving a dead animal skin.”  But then, I know how dumb it sounds when you reduce the things I like to similar absurdities such as “pressing buttons in front of a glowing box all day.”</p>

<p>I’d love to hate on sports fans, but as it turns out human nature isn’t actually that different between different subcultures.  It just puts on different clothes.  I guess I’ll have to find some other group to feel superior to.</p>
