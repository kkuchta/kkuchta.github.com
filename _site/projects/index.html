<h2><a href="vimbits.com">Vimbits.com</a> <span class='github'><a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/Vimbits">[github]</a></span></h2>

<p>A site to upvote and downvote your favorite Vim configuration snippets.  Made with Bootstrap and Rails (decided to keep it largely js-free for v1).  Hit the HN front page twice, and got about 12k uniques in the first week or so.  It's levelled off to around 80 uniques a day.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.ubimenu.com/">Ubimenu.com</a></h2>

<p>A tool for restaurants and bars to have a simple mobile webapp with no coding experience required.  I worked on the frontend stuff: the welcome page, the admin panel, and a bit of the mobile js.</p>

<hr>


<h2><a href="kevinkuchta.com">KevinKuchta.com</a> <span class='github'><a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/kkuchta.github.com">[github]</a></span></h2>

<p>Included here for completeness, this is a generated static Jekyll-based site hosted on github pages.  I've added in Haml for the html and Sass for the css, along with Jekyll's built-in markdown parsing for the content.  I started from a bootstrap base, but the visible design and css are my own.</p>

<h1>Graveyard</h1>

<h2>Rayne, aka ShitIbuilt.com</h2>

<p>This was intended to be a competitor to Linkedin that was focused on "Shit I Built".  It addressed the problem that although I have a bunch of friends, I can't really vouch for many of them as good programmers/designers/marketers/whatever, as I just haven't worked with them.  This was meant to be an 'anti-social network' where the key link was not friendship or aquaintence, but shared projects.</p>

<p>Rayne (our internal name) died on the vine as we became less convinced that we had the interest to make it happen.  We built a minimum product, but the 'viable' part was not really there: an idea that simple really needed a lot more polish than we had the time to give it (and we weren't nearly confident enough about the idea to go full-time on it).  The remenants of it can be found at <a href="http://shitibuilt.com/">http://shitibuilt.com/</a> or directly on <a href="http://quiet-rain-7455.herokuapp.com/">heroku</a>, although that link will probably die eventually.</p>
