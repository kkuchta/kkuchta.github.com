<div class="archive-summary"><p>This is just another one of those posts summarizing some time I wasted so hopefully someone else won't waste theirs.</p>

<p>If you have a big list of suppressions (emails of users who unsubscribed, marked you as spam, etc) from another email provider (eg Sendgrid) and want to import them into Mailgun, there's no easy way to do it.  The web UI doesn't seem to have a way and their SDKs don't support it yet.</p>

<p>Their API, however, does.  Here's a little ruby script that will read a sendgrid csv and upload all the emails to mailgun as suppressions (in this case "complaints", which are the equivalent of sendgrid's "spam" list emails).</p>

<div class="archive-summary"><h3>The basics</h3>

<p>I spend plenty of time in the rails console in my local dev environment, and I often find myself in need of dummy data or specific objects set up to mess around with.  For example, the user I test most things with is KevinKuchta, so I might run <code>kevin = User.find_by_username('KevinKuchta')</code>.  It's like 40 characters long, but I type it often enough that I'd love to optimize it (and similar bits of code).</p>

<div class="archive-summary"><p>I heard a fun statistic today: the average software development turnover rate is 20% annually.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics says 33% for all departures in IT, and 15% for quits.  Let's say it's 20%- that's a whole new company every 5 years (not really, of course, but it's still a significant chunk of your company gone in that period).  How can any company achieve consistent results when more than half their company is swapped out every 3 years?  Predictable budgets and schedules become hella-difficult, not even to mention the cost of training new employees and the lost production while that's happening.</p>
