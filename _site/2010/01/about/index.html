          <div>I'm Kevin Kuchta.&nbsp; I'm a 23 year old Software Engineer at the Rochester Institute of Technology. &nbsp;I recently got off a co-op doing C# development with Parse3 in Warwick, NY, and I'm working on the home-stretch of college (graduation in May 2011).</div><br />I've been programming since early high school, and dabbling in web design (html/css) even longer.&nbsp; My interests tend to lie in personal and/or web software.&nbsp; I love all aspects of the development cycle (except documentation- though incredibly necessary, it's no fun to write).<br /><br />In my spare time I like to work on my own projects, but when I'm not doing that I explore abandoned buildings, take photos, draw, play soccer/frisbee, do stuff with friends, and bike a little.<br /><br />I worked at GE MDS writing desktop software for industrial radios.&nbsp; Since I was on a very small team (2-3 people), I was able to participate in the entire software process, from conception to maintenance, interacting with managers, customers, and sales people.&nbsp; A few fun lessons I learned:<br /><ul><li>Poor testing is far more painful than writing tests.&nbsp; I'd been told this before, but it took a first-hand burn to really understand it.</li><li>There's no such thing as being <i>too</i> prepared for requirements changes</li><li>Being able to pick up new tools and technologies on the fly is a necessary part of life as a developer.</li><li>The dreaded cubicle farms aren't that bad when you have fascinating work and fresh coffee.<br /></li></ul>Of course, I learned so much that I'm actually a little ashamed of some of the work I did there, having learned how to do it so much better by the end.<br /><br />After that I co-oped at IBM, working with the Lotus Connections team.&nbsp; This was my introduction to heavy front-end web development: I was writing js widgets in Dojo running in enterprise webapps (Mashups and Connections) running on Websphere.&nbsp; A few lessons I learned:<br /><ul><li>Usability is not a given, even at very large and successful companies.</li><li>Performance can be a significant part of usability.</li><li>No amount of intelligent coworkers and casual work environment can make up for uninteresting work.</li></ul><div>My last co-op was with a small company (~25 people) in Warwick, NY called Parse3. &nbsp;I worked on the back-end of http://kumon.com, among other web development project. &nbsp;I got to teach myself C# and ASP, and played with a gigantic CMS called Sitecore. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Parse3 ran low on money and work, so I ended up getting laid off along with around half the development team. &nbsp;Some lessons learned there:</div><div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Autonomy and a short management hierarchy is pretty neat</li><li>Don't trust contract work to always be plentiful</li><li>Open, cube-less work environments have some unique advantages</li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>I'm currently looking for full time work starting in the spring or summer of 2011. &nbsp;My preference is towards smaller companies, though to be honest I'll work for anyone that can give me stimulating projects. &nbsp;And, you know, a decent wage- can't pay rent on interesting work (unfortunately).</div>
