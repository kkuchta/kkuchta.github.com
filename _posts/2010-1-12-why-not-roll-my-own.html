Writing a blog engine is a right of passage for young developers.<!--break-->&nbsp; It is the web equivalent of printing Fibonacci numbers or calculating the sides of a triangle- step number two after Hello World.&nbsp; As such, the question is raised:<br /><br />Why don't I roll my own?<br /><br />The first answer to that is that there's not much more to be gained from it.&nbsp; It was useful when I was first learning HTML, then CSS, then PHP, then Rails, as a project with some practical application that also has enough technical requirements to flex the tool being learnt a little.<br /><br />Further, it scaled well to various tools (when learning HTML, I could do a simple static-page blog; when learning rails, I could do a dynamic mvc blog engine with tests and a db).&nbsp; Now, though, I know enough about the principle web tools (HTML/CSS) and a smattering of languages + frameworks (CodeIgniter, Rails, etc) that building another blog engine in them just isn't that useful to me.<br /><br />Secondly, the need for this project to be done outweighs my need to learn from it.&nbsp; I've gone through half a dozen iterations of my personal site- each time better and more complex.&nbsp; The problem is that when using a project as a learning tool, it never gets done.<br /><br />By the time I finished building one of the first versions of my site with table based layouts, I'd figured out that css layouts were much better.&nbsp; By the time I finished a static css-layout site, I realized that even a little php could make modifications much easier, etc, etc.&nbsp; I always want to rewrite it in light of the flaws I learnt while writing it.&nbsp; At this point, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2009/12/kevin-kuchtas-blog/">I need a solid web presence</a> that isn't constantly changing.<br /><br />Thirdly, I want the sort of features that a mature product gives.&nbsp; I can roll a basic blog engine with post and paginated archives in 20 minutes in Rails (less using generators), but then what?&nbsp; Then I want comments on that, so I write comments in another 20.&nbsp; Then I realize that I want formatting for my comments and blog posts, so I spend some time putting in markdown.&nbsp; Then I get a spammer in the comments, so I put in captchas.&nbsp; Then I decide that I upload enough images that I'd like a way to do that through the ui, rather than ftp-ing to the server.&nbsp; Then I need... and so on.<br /><br />Role-based authentication, searching, skins, analytics, performance optimiziation, OpenId, RSS/Atom, etc.&nbsp; These are all things I can or can learn to do, but it often means I have to choose between living without the feature or putting all my other pojects (and the writing itself) on hold to do it.&nbsp; Having a well thought out platform like MovableType, with the features I'm likely to need already there, allows me to focus on other things.<br /><br />So, why not roll my own? Because it's no longer educational, I need this site for itself, and I want a full-featured system.&nbsp; Good enough reasons for me.
