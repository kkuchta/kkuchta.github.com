I recently undertook participation in [RIT48](http://rit48.com) with my good friends [Chris 'Cap' Tosswill](http://tosswill.net/) (a fellow software engineer) and [Meghan Manders](http://meghanmanders.com/) (a designer).  RIT48 is a competition to create a web business in 48 hours, with mixed emphasis on business plan and implementation.  Our team got a working prototype of our product ([FulStack.com](http://fulstack.com)) up and running, and we won second place (+ $400)!  More details in [the project page](http://www.kevinkuchta.com/blog/projects/fulstack.html).
