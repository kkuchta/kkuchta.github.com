<blockquote>"A man's domain is his castle"<br /></blockquote>I've been kicking around the internet since I was a kid, and I've owned various websites about as long.&nbsp; From the HTML course I took over the summer in elementary school to the rails system I put together a couple years back, I've always had some online representation, often tied to various user names and interests.&nbsp; I've made Starcraft fan pages, webcomics, rough cms's, collections of written work- everything but the standard blog.<br /><br />What I've lacked until now, though, has been a place directly associated with Kevin Michael Kuchta.&nbsp; The closest thing to that is my facebook page, which isn't the front I want to show the world.&nbsp; To this end, I'm getting my hair combed, buying a respectable domain name, and putting a decent blog there.&nbsp; That's this thing.<br /><br />I'll get into the decisions I've made concerning this site, the history of my online presence, my current place in life, etc in future posts- this is just to say why this site exists: to be a stable repository for all things Kevin Kuchta.<br />
