            As a full stack developer using <b>rails</b> and <b>angular.js</b>, I helped this mental health startup grow from 5 to 40 people.  I built many user-facing activities, improved <b>frontend performance</b>, integrated our payments processor, built the subscription system, wrote the internal admin tools, and drove the transition towards an <b>SPA</b>.
