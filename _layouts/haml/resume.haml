            I was an early developer at this SAAS Expense Reporting startup.  I worked on both the <b>PHP</b> backend (bank integrations, a <b>mechanical turk</b> system, html receipt parsing, among other things) and the heavy <b>JS</b> frontend (tiered feature-sets, report permissions, dropbox integration).
