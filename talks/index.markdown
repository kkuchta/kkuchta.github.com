# Conference Talks

## Ruby is the Best Javascript

Presented at RubyConf 2018 [[video]](http://confreaks.tv/videos/rubyconf2018-ruby-is-the-best-javascript) [[slides]](https://speakerdeck.com/kkuchta/ruby-is-the-best-javascript)

Some people love Ruby and some people love Javascript. Both will hate this talk. In a display of complete moral depravity, we'll abuse flexible syntax and metaprogramming to make valid Ruby code that's indistinguishable from Javascript. We'll use a variety of tricks to accomplish it that you can take home and use in more respectable code

## Source-Diving for Fun and Profit

Presented at RubyConf 2019 [[video]](https://talksatconfs.com/talks/28a14e1a-4bdc-4faa-836f-0ea39923ff04/source-diving-for-fun-and-profit) [[slides]](https://speakerdeck.com/kkuchta/source-diving-for-fun-and-profit)

Ever spent hours pouring over a gem's documentation trying to figure out how to make it work? Dug through dozens of blog posts trying to understand why a library's not working? Well what if I promised you an end to all that?! Well, ok, I'd be lying. But maybe I can save you some hair-pulling some of the time! Let me introduce you to the joys of Reading the Code. Maybe it seems obvious to you, but one of the biggest leaps I made as a ruby dev was really getting comfortable jumping into a gem's source as a debugging technique. In an effort to get you over that hump earlier than I did, let's talk tips and tricks for getting in and out of a library's codebase as efficiently as possible. It won't solve every problem, but sometimes 5 minutes on GitHub will save you hours on StackOverflow.
