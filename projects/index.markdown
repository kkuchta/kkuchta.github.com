Github: [https://github.com/kkuchta/Vimbits](https://github.com/kkuchta/Vimbits)

A site to upvote and downvote your favorite Vim configuration snippets.  Made with Bootstrap and Rails (decided to keep it largely js-free for v1).  Hit the HN front page twice, and got about 12k uniques in the first week or so.  It's levelled off to around 80 uniques a day.
