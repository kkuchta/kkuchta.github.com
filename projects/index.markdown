# Projects

## [Vimbits.com](vimbits.com) <span class='github'>[[github]](https://github.com/kkuchta/Vimbits)</span>

A site to upvote and downvote your favorite Vim configuration snippets.  Made with Bootstrap and Rails (decided to keep it largely js-free for v1).  Hit the HN front page twice, and got about 12k uniques in the first week or so.  It's levelled off to around 80 uniques a day.

## [Ubimenu.com](http://www.ubimenu.com/)

A tool for restaurants and bars to have a simple mobile webapp with no coding experience required.  I worked on the frontend stuff: the welcome page, the admin panel, and a bit of the mobile js.

## [KevinKuchta.com](kevinkuchta.com) <span class='github'>[[github]](https://github.com/kkuchta/kkuchta.github.com)</span>

Included here for completeness, this is a generated static Jekyll-based site hosted on github pages.  I've added in Haml for the html and Sass for the css, along with Jekyll's built-in markdown parsing for the content.  I started from a bootstrap base, but the visible design and css are my own.

# Graveyard

## Rayne, aka ShitIbuilt.com

This was intended to be a competitor to Linkedin that was focused on "Shit I Built".  It addressed the problem that although I have a bunch of friends, I can't really vouch for many of them as good programmers/designers/marketers/whatever, as I just haven't worked with them.  This was meant to be an 'anti-social network' where the key link was not friendship or aquaintence, but shared projects.

Rayne (our internal name) died on the vine as we became less convinced that we had the interest to make it happen.  We built a minimum product, but the 'viable' part was not really there: an idea that simple really needed a lot more polish than we had the time to give it (and we weren't nearly confident enough about the idea to go full-time on it).  The remenants of it can be found at [http://shitibuilt.com/](http://shitibuilt.com/) or directly on [heroku](http://quiet-rain-7455.herokuapp.com/), although that link will probably die eventually.
